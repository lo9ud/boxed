# UI

This document describes the user interface used in this project.

## Overview

The user interface is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is a good choice for this project because it allows for easy state management and updating, which is important for a spreadsheet-like application, as well as rapid prototyping and development.

The React code is compiled with Next.js and static files are served using Tauri, a framework for building desktop applications using web technologies.

In combination, this allows for rapid hotloading during development, which was importnat as this is the first project of such a scale that I have worked on. It also allows for easy deployment to multiple platforms, as Tauri supports Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
