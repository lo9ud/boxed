# Model

This document describes the data model used in the project.

## Overview

The data model is based on a column-oriented data model. This means that data is stored in columns, rather than rows. This is a common model for spreadsheet applications, as it allows for easy manipulation of data.

This results in what is effectively a highly simplified version of a SQL table. Each column has a name and a type, and each row is a value for each column.
